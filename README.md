I completed a comprehensive data science project focused on building a real estate price prediction website. The project was executed in several steps:

Model Development: Using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, I built a predictive model using Python's Scikit-learn library, specifically employing linear regression.

Python Flask Server: I then developed a Python Flask server that serves HTTP requests by utilizing the saved model to predict real estate prices based on user inputs.

Web Development: Finally, I created a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to input details such as home square footage, the number of bedrooms, etc., and then calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Throughout the model-building phase, I applied key data science concepts including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.

Technologies and tools used:

Python: Core language for development Numpy and Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation Matplotlib: For data visualization Scikit-learn: For model building Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: As Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
